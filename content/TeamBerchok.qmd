We primarily deploy passive acoustic recorders on subsurface moorings throughout the Bering, Beaufort, and Chukchi Seas, as well as in the Gulf of Alaska. They autonomously record underwater sounds for a year at a time.|  
|We also conduct shorter-term real-time passive acoustic monitoring via sonobuoys from vessels.|
